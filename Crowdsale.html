<h1>Droplet (DPT)</h1>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Im making an crowdsale for people to invest in the website, the coins will be very limited and will act like shares, so you earn money by holding the coins.</b> </h2>
<h3><b>If you hold 1% of the coins you earn 1% of all earning from the website, from fees, adds and sponsors. </b></h3>
    <h3><b>Exactly how you will be paid is not set yet, the choice is between giving out coins to holders or burn coins monthly for increased value.</b></h3>
<h3><b>The token is called Droplet, and there will be a total supply of 100 000 tokens.</b></h3>
<h3><b>Not all of the coins will be sold in this crowdsale, but there will be sales later when the coin is more complete.</b></h3>
<h3><b>Therefore this is an opportunity to buy Droplet tokens before it gains its potential value</b></h3>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Droplet is an ERC-20 token, so it runs on the Ethereum network as a smartcontract.</b></h2>
<h3><b>The crowdsale had to be made to fund further development of the website.</b></h3>
<h3><b>Im creating a website where people can buy and sell cryptocurrencies for USD/EUR/JPY in real time,</b></h3>
<h3><b>the site has the money and the cryptocurrencies so you buy instantly and sell instantly with 0.5% fee.</b></h3>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<h2><b>The tokens will be rewarded automatically to the address you sent Ethereum from.</b></h2>
<h3><b>Be aware, most exchanges doesn't support tokens yet so I recommend you to be using a private wallet and not a thirdparty wallet like an exchange or Coinbase.</b></h3>
<h3><b>Remember to send Ethereum and not other cryptocurrencies to the adress.</b></h3>

<h3><b>The Crowdsale is now live and ends the 23. of December.</b></h3>
<h3><b>The goal is 500 Ether, once the goal is reached the crowdsale ends.</b></h3>
<h3><b>The price per Token is 0.1 Ether.</b></h3>
